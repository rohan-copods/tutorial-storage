# markup Tutorial

Welcome to the comprehensive tutorial for markup. This tutorial is automatically generated from the codebase to help you understand the core concepts and implementation patterns.

## Project Overview

The Django Project serves as the encompassing structure for a web application, configured by its Project Settings and managed via Project Management Commands. It processes web requests by using URL Routing to direct them to appropriate Views, which handle the application's logic. All communication between the Django application and a web server is facilitated by the Web Server Gateway Interface ('WSGI') standard.
