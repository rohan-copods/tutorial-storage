# markup Tutorial

Welcome to the comprehensive tutorial for markup. This tutorial is automatically generated from the codebase to help you understand the core concepts and implementation patterns.

## Project Overview

This project is structured as a Django web application, utilizing its core abstractions for development and operation. The 'manage.py' script serves as the primary command-line interface for project administration, including server management and environment setup. It orchestrates the loading of URL configurations which then map incoming web requests to specific Python views responsible for processing the requests and generating responses.
