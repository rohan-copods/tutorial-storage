# multi-tenant-docs Tutorial

Welcome to the comprehensive tutorial for multi-tenant-docs. This tutorial is automatically generated from the codebase to help you understand the core concepts and implementation patterns.

## Project Overview

The 'multi-tenant-docs' project delivers a dynamic documentation platform capable of serving content for multiple tenants and versions. It integrates Next.js routing to map URLs to specific documentation, a content management system to process MDX files, and context management to maintain the active tenant and version, ensuring the correct content is always presented. This architecture provides flexibility for content delivery and user experience across different documentation instances.

## Table of Contents

1. [Tenant and Version Context Management](chapter_01.md) - In modern web applications, it's common to serve multiple organizations or users, each with their own isolated data and settingsâ€”a concept known as multi-tenancy.
2. [Dynamic Documentation Routing](chapter_02.md) - The 'Dynamic Documentation Routing' abstraction is a core component for managing documentation in complex environments where content varies by tenant and by version.
3. [Chapter 3: The Documentation Content Management System (DCMS)](chapter_03.md) - The Documentation Content Management System (DCMS) is a core abstraction responsible for turning raw documentation files into renderable web content.
