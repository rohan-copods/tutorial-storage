# Chapter 1: Wit.ai Client

Welcome to the 'wit-go' project documentation! This first chapter introduces you to the foundational component: the `Wit.ai Client`. As the entry point for all interactions with the Wit.ai API, understanding its purpose and usage is crucial for building any application with `wit-go`.

---

### Problem & Motivation

Integrating with external APIs like Wit.ai often presents several challenges for developers. You typically need to:
1.  **Handle HTTP requests**: Constructing URLs, setting headers, choosing the right HTTP method (GET, POST).
2.  **Manage authentication**: Securely storing and sending API tokens with every request.
3.  **Parse responses**: Decoding JSON data into Go structs, handling potential errors from the API.
4.  **Abstract complexity**: Dealing with different API endpoints for various services (NLU, STT, entity management, etc.).

Without a dedicated client library, developers would spend significant time writing boilerplate code, increasing the risk of errors and slowing down development. The core problem is the *friction* involved in connecting a Go application to a powerful AI service like Wit.ai.

The `wit-go` project solves this by providing an official Go client library. The `Wit.ai Client` abstraction is central to this solution, offering a streamlined, Go-idiomatic way to interact with Wit.ai. Imagine you want to quickly add natural language understanding (NLU) to a simple Go chatbot. Instead of manually crafting HTTP requests to Wit.ai's `/message` endpoint, the `Wit.ai Client` allows you to simply call a method like `client.Message.Extract("hello world")` and receive parsed NLU data directly in Go structs. This significantly speeds up development and reduces the learning curve for integrating advanced NLU capabilities.

### Core Concept Explanation

At its heart, the `Wit.ai Client` (represented by the `wit.Client` struct in `wit-go`) is your application's **gateway to the Wit.ai API**. Think of it as a specialized remote control that understands all the different functions and capabilities of your Wit.ai application.

It encapsulates the essential elements needed to communicate with Wit.ai:
*   **Authentication**: It securely holds your Wit.ai API token, ensuring that all requests made through it are properly authorized. Without this token, Wit.ai cannot identify your application or access your training data.
*   **Endpoint Access**: It provides structured access to various Wit.ai services through dedicated sub-clients, such as `Client.Message` for NLU, `Client.Intent` for managing intents, and so on. This modular design keeps the API organized and easy to navigate.
*   **HTTP Communication**: Internally, it manages the underlying HTTP requests and responses, abstracting away the complexities of `net/http`. This means you don't have to worry about low-level network details; you just call Go methods.

The `wit.Client` is the *first object* you need to create when using `wit-go`. It initializes the connection parameters and makes subsequent API calls much simpler. For instance, to process a user's utterance for NLU, you don't interact directly with Wit.ai's `/message` endpoint; instead, you use the `Message` sub-client provided by the `wit.Client`. This structured approach ensures consistency, simplifies error handling, and promotes cleaner code.

### Practical Usage Examples

Let's dive into how to create and use the `Wit.ai Client` to solve our motivating use case: quickly processing a user message for NLU.

First, you need a Wit.ai API token. You can find this in your Wit.ai application settings. For security, it's best practice to load this from an environment variable.

#### 1. Importing the Library

To begin, import the `wit-go` package in your Go application:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"

	wit "github.com/wit-ai/wit-go" // Standard import for wit-go
)
```
*Explanation*: This imports the necessary package, typically aliased as `wit` for brevity.

#### 2. Creating a New Wit.ai Client

Instantiate the `wit.Client` using the `wit.NewClient` function, passing your API token.

```go
func main() {
	// Retrieve your Wit.ai API token from an environment variable
	apiToken := os.Getenv("WIT_AI_ACCESS_TOKEN")
	if apiToken == "" {
		fmt.Println("Error: WIT_AI_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable not set.")
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	// Create a new Wit.ai client
	client := wit.NewClient(apiToken)
	fmt.Println("Wit.ai client created successfully!")
}
```
*Explanation*: The `wit.NewClient()` function takes your API token and returns an initialized `wit.Client` instance. It's crucial to handle cases where the token might be missing.

#### 3. Processing a Message (NLU)

Now that we have a client, we can use its `Message` sub-client to process a text input, which is our motivating use case for NLU.

```go
func main() {
	// ... (client creation code from above) ...

	// Send a message for NLU processing
	message, err := client.Message.Extract("What's the weather like in Paris?")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error processing message: %v\n", err)
		return
	}

	// Print the NLU response
	fmt.Println("NLU Response:")
	fmt.Printf("  Text: %s\n", message.Text)
	fmt.Printf("  Intent: %s\n", message.Intents[0].Name)
	// Output will vary based on your Wit.ai app's training
}
```
*Explanation*: `client.Message.Extract()` sends the text "What's the weather like in Paris?" to Wit.ai. If successful, it returns a `wit.MessageResponse` struct containing the NLU results, including detected intents and entities. The example then prints the text and the name of the top intent.

This sequence demonstrates how easily `wit-go` allows you to integrate complex NLU features into your application with just a few lines of code, thanks to the `wit.Client` abstraction.

### Internal Implementation Walkthrough

The `wit.Client` is relatively straightforward in its internal structure, but it's the foundation upon which all other API interactions are built.

At its core, the `wit.Client` struct (defined in `client.go`) looks something like this:

```go
// Simplified view of the wit.Client struct
type Client struct {
	APIToken    string
	HTTPClient  *http.Client
	BaseURL     string

	Message *MessageService
	Intent  *IntentService
	// ... other services
}
```

#### 1. Initialization (`wit.NewClient`)

When you call `wit.NewClient(apiToken string)`, the following steps occur:
*   A new `wit.Client` instance is created.
*   The provided `apiToken` is stored in the `APIToken` field.
*   A default `*http.Client` (from Go's standard `net/http` package) is initialized and assigned to the `HTTPClient` field. This client is responsible for making all network requests.
*   The `BaseURL` for Wit.ai (e.g., `https://api.wit.ai`) is set.
*   Crucially, all the service clients (`MessageService`, `IntentService`, etc.) are initialized and attached to the `Client` instance. These services are pointers to structs that know how to interact with specific Wit.ai API endpoints, and they share the parent `wit.Client`'s `APIToken` and `HTTPClient`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Your Go Application
    participant WitClient as wit.Client
    participant HTTPClient as *http.Client
    participant MessageService as MessageService
    participant IntentService as IntentService

    App->>WitClient: wit.NewClient(apiToken)
    activate WitClient
    WitClient->>HTTPClient: New default http.Client{}
    WitClient->>MessageService: New(WitClient)
    WitClient->>IntentService: New(WitClient)
    WitClient-->>App: Returns initialized client
    deactivate WitClient
```
*Explanation*: This diagram shows how your application creates the `wit.Client`, which in turn sets up the underlying HTTP client and initializes its specialized service components (`MessageService`, `IntentService`, etc.), making them ready for use.

#### 2. Making an API Call (e.g., `Client.Message.Extract`)

When you call a method like `client.Message.Extract("text")`:
*   The `Extract` method, belonging to the `MessageService`, is invoked.
*   Internally, the `MessageService` uses the `APIToken` and `HTTPClient` it inherited from the `wit.Client`.
*   It constructs the appropriate HTTP request (e.g., `GET /message?v=20230215&q=text`).
*   It adds the `Authorization` header with the `APIToken`.
*   It uses the shared `HTTPClient` to send the request to the Wit.ai API.
*   Upon receiving a response, it handles parsing the JSON into the relevant Go struct (`wit.MessageResponse`) and checks for API errors.
*   Finally, it returns the parsed data or an error back to your application.

This design ensures that all API calls are routed through a single, well-configured client, simplifying error handling, authentication, and connection management.

### System Integration

The `wit.Client` is the **root** of the `wit-go` library's structure. Every other major component and feature in 'wit-go' integrates directly with or depends on an instance of `wit.Client`.

*   **Service Abstraction**: The `wit.Client` provides access to distinct service managers:
    *   `client.Message`: For [Message Processing (NLU)](chapter_03.md).
    *   `client.Intent`: For [Intent Management](chapter_04.md).
    *   `client.Entity`: For [Entity Management](chapter_05.md).
    *   `client.Utterance`: For [Utterance Management](chapter_06.md).
    *   `client.Speech`: For [Dictation (Speech-to-Text)](chapter_07.md).
Each of these "sub-clients" is initialized with a reference to the main `wit.Client`'s `APIToken` and `HTTPClient`, allowing them to make authorized requests efficiently.

*   **Standard Go `net/http`**: The library leverages Go's robust `net/http` package for all network communication. This means developers familiar with Go's standard library will find the underlying mechanisms intuitive.
*   **Error Handling**: The `wit.Client` and its services are designed to return standard Go `error` types, allowing for consistent error handling throughout your application.

Data flow generally originates from your application, passes through a `wit.Client` method, makes an HTTP request to Wit.ai, receives a response, which is then unmarshaled into Go structs and returned to your application. This centralized communication hub simplifies debugging and ensures consistent behavior across all API interactions.

### Best Practices & Tips

To get the most out of the `Wit.ai Client` and ensure your application is robust and secure, consider these best practices:

*   **API Token Security**: Never hardcode your Wit.ai API token directly into your source code. Instead, load it from environment variables (e.g., `WIT_AI_ACCESS_TOKEN`), a configuration file, or a secure secret management system. This prevents accidental exposure and allows easy configuration across different environments.
*   **Client Reuse**: Create a single instance of `wit.Client` when your application starts and reuse it for all subsequent API calls. Do *not* create a new `wit.Client` for every request. Creating a new client repeatedly can lead to resource exhaustion and degraded performance, as each client might initialize its own HTTP client and connections.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: Always check the `error` return value from `wit-go` functions. Wit.ai's API might return errors due to various reasons (invalid input, rate limiting, internal server issues). Implement proper error logging and graceful degradation in your application.
*   **Consider Context for Requests**: For longer-running applications or those sensitive to timeouts, you can customize the underlying `*http.Client` that `wit-go` uses, especially for setting timeouts or using context for cancellation. We'll explore this more in the next chapter.
