# react-markdown Tutorial

Welcome to the comprehensive tutorial for react-markdown. This tutorial is automatically generated from the codebase to help you understand the core concepts and implementation patterns.

## Project Overview

'react-markdown' is a React component designed to parse and render Markdown content as a tree of React elements. It internally utilizes the 'remark' and 'rehype' ecosystem to process the Markdown through a configurable pipeline, allowing developers to extend its functionality with plugins and customize the rendering of specific Markdown elements using their own React components.
