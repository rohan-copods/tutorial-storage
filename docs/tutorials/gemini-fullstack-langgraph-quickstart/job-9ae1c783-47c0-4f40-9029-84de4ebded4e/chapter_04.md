# Chapter 4: Agent Prompts

In the previous chapter, [Agent Tools and Schemas](chapter_03.md), we explored how our agent defines and interacts with external functionalities and structures data for its operations. While tools provide the *what* an agent can do, it's the *how* and *why* that often dictates its effectiveness. This is where Agent Prompts come into play, serving as the guiding intelligence for our Large Language Model (LLM).

---

### Problem & Motivation

Large Language Models (LLMs) are incredibly powerful, capable of understanding complex queries and generating coherent responses. However, without proper guidance, they can be unfocused, generate irrelevant information, or fail to adhere to specific task requirements. Imagine trying to direct an expert without giving them clear instructions or context; their output, while potentially brilliant, might not align with your specific needs. In the context of an AI agent, this lack of direction can lead to inefficient tool usage, inaccurate responses, or an inability to follow a desired workflow.

In our `gemini-fullstack-langgraph-quickstart` project, the agent needs to perform specific tasks, such as conducting research, planning steps, and synthesizing information. To ensure it acts intelligently and purposefully at each stage of its [Agent Workflow Nodes](chapter_02.md), we must provide it with precise instructions, persona, and contextual information. Agent Prompts solve this by acting as the primary interface for directing the LLM's reasoning, enabling it to make informed decisions about when to use which [Agent Tools and Schemas](chapter_03.md), what information to extract from the [Agent State](chapter_01.md), and how to formulate its final output.

For instance, consider an agent tasked with researching a topic. Without a carefully crafted prompt, it might just provide a generic overview. With effective prompting, we can instruct it to perform a web search, analyze results for specific entities, synthesize findings, and even format its output in a particular way, such as a summary followed by key takeaways. Prompts are the orchestrators of the LLM's cognitive process, transforming raw LLM power into directed, task-oriented intelligence within our agent.

### Core Concept Explanation

Agent Prompts are essentially the textual instructions, constraints, and contextual information fed to a Large Language Model (LLM) to steer its behavior and output. Think of them as the agent's "mindset" or "briefing document." They define the role the LLM should adopt, the goals it needs to achieve, the current context of the conversation or task, and even examples of desired interactions. This structured guidance is crucial for harnessing the LLM's vast knowledge in a controlled and predictable manner.

In our LangGraph-based agent, prompts are dynamic and adaptable. They are constructed at various points in the workflow, incorporating elements from the evolving [Agent State](chapter_01.md), descriptions of available [Agent Tools and Schemas](chapter_03.md), and predefined system instructions. This allows the LLM to receive highly relevant and up-to-date information, enabling it to make intelligent decisions about its next action â€“ whether that's performing a calculation, querying a database, or generating a user-facing response.

Key components of effective prompts often include:
*   **System Instructions**: Defining the agent's persona, overall goals, and general rules of engagement.
*   **Contextual Information**: Relevant details from the ongoing conversation or task, pulled directly from the [Agent State](chapter_01.md).
*   **Tool Descriptions**: Clear, concise explanations of the functionalities the agent can use, often including their input schemas. This is critical for the LLM to understand *how* and *when* to invoke tools.
*   **User Query**: The specific request or question from the user that the agent needs to address.

By carefully crafting these prompts, we transform the generic capabilities of an LLM into a specialized, task-driven AI agent that can reason through complex problems, interact with external systems, and deliver precise, contextually appropriate responses. They are the backbone of the agent's decision-making process, ensuring alignment with the project's objectives at every step.

### Practical Usage Examples

Let's illustrate how prompts are constructed and used within our project. A common requirement for an agent is to be aware of the current date, perhaps for time-sensitive research or scheduling. We can dynamically inject this information into our prompt.

Consider the `get_current_date` function provided in `backend/src/agent/prompts.py`:

```python
# backend/src/agent/prompts.py
from datetime import datetime

def get_current_date():
    return datetime.now().strftime("%B %d, %Y")
```
This simple function retrieves and formats the current date. Now, let's see how we might integrate this into a system prompt.

```python
# Example: Constructing a system prompt
from langchain_core.prompts import SystemMessagePromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, ChatPromptTemplate

def create_initial_prompt(current_date: str):
    system_template = f"""
    You are an AI assistant designed to help users with information retrieval and synthesis.
    The current date is {current_date}.
    Your primary goal is to provide accurate and concise answers based on the tools you have.
    """
    system_message = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(system_template)
    return ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([system_message])

# Usage example
current_date_str = get_current_date()
initial_prompt = create_initial_prompt(current_date_str)
print(initial_prompt.format())
```
This code snippet demonstrates creating a `ChatPromptTemplate` which is a powerful way to define prompts using `langchain_core`. The `SystemMessagePromptTemplate` establishes the agent's role and includes dynamic information like the current date. When `format()` is called, the `current_date_str` is embedded directly into the prompt.

**Explanation:**
The `create_initial_prompt` function takes the `current_date` as an argument and embeds it directly into a system message. This means every time the agent's LLM receives this prompt, it will be aware of the current date, allowing it to provide more relevant and time-sensitive information. The `ChatPromptTemplate` acts as a container for different types of messages (system, human, AI).

Next, let's consider how tool descriptions are integrated into a prompt. This is crucial for the LLM to understand *what* tools it can use and *how* to invoke them.

```python
# Example: Incorporating tool descriptions into a prompt
from langchain_core.prompts import MessagesPlaceholder

def create_tool_use_prompt(tools_description: str):
    system_template = """
    You are an expert researcher.
    You have access to the following tools:
    {tools}
    Based on the user's query and your knowledge, decide whether to use a tool or provide a direct answer.
    """
    human_template = "{input}" # User's actual query
    
    # Placeholder for chat history and tool messages
    chat_history_placeholder = MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="chat_history")
    
    # Combine system, tool instructions, and human input
    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
        SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(system_template),
        chat_history_placeholder, # To maintain conversation context
        HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template)
    ])
    return prompt.partial(tools=tools_description) # Pass tools description here

# Usage example (simplified)
# Assume 'formatted_tools_desc' is generated from Agent Tools and Schemas
formatted_tools_desc = "tool_name(arg: str) -> result: This tool does X." 
tool_prompt = create_tool_use_prompt(formatted_tools_desc)
print(tool_prompt.format(input="What is the capital of France?", chat_history=[]))
```
**Explanation:**
Here, `create_tool_use_prompt` takes `tools_description` and inserts it into the system prompt. The `{tools}` placeholder is filled using `.partial()` for convenience. A `MessagesPlaceholder` named `chat_history` is included to allow the agent to retain conversational context, crucial for multi-turn interactions. This prompt guides the LLM to understand its available tools and when to use them.

### Internal Implementation Walkthrough

The creation and management of prompts in the `gemini-fullstack-langgraph-quickstart` project largely leverage the `langchain_core` library, particularly `ChatPromptTemplate` and its various message types (`SystemMessagePromptTemplate`, `HumanMessagePromptTemplate`, `AIMessagePromptTemplate`). These structures allow for flexible and dynamic prompt construction.

At its core, prompt implementation involves:
1.  **Defining Base Templates**: Establishing the static parts of the prompt, such as the agent's persona or overall instructions. These are often `SystemMessagePromptTemplate` instances.
2.  **Injecting Dynamic Content**: Incorporating information that changes per interaction or workflow step. This includes:
    *   **Current Date/Time**: As seen with `get_current_date()` in `backend/src/agent/prompts.py`, this adds temporal awareness.
    *   **User Input**: The actual query or message from the user, typically mapped to a `HumanMessagePromptTemplate`.
    *   **Agent State Context**: Relevant data points from the [Agent State](chapter_01.md), such as previous research results, search queries, or conversation history. This is often handled via `MessagesPlaceholder`.
    *   **Tool Information**: Descriptions and schemas of available [Agent Tools and Schemas](chapter_03.md), enabling the LLM to decide on tool usage.
3.  **Constructing the Final Prompt**: Combining these components into a single `ChatPromptTemplate` which is then passed to the LLM.

Let's visualize the prompt construction process within an agent's decision-making flow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start Node/Agent State Update] --> B{Retrieve Context from State};
    B --> C[Fetch Available Tools & Schemas];
    C --> D[Retrieve System Instructions/Persona];
    D --> E[Get Current Date/Other Dynamic Info (e.g., get_current_date)];
    B & C & D & E --> F[Construct ChatPromptTemplate];
    F --> G{Invoke LLM with Prompt};
    G --> H[LLM Response/Tool Invocation];
    H --> I[Update Agent State];
    I --> J[Next Workflow Node];
```

*   **Step 1: Context Retrieval (B)**: When an [Agent Workflow Nodes](chapter_02.md) needs to consult the LLM, it first accesses the current [Agent State](chapter_01.md) to gather relevant historical messages, user input, and any ongoing research data.
*   **Step 2: Tool Information (C)**: The node also retrieves descriptions and schemas for any tools the agent might be able to use in the current context (as defined in [Agent Tools and Schemas](chapter_03.md)).
*   **Step 3: Base Instructions & Dynamic Data (D & E)**: Core system instructions that define the agent's role and any dynamic data, like the current date from `backend/src/agent/prompts.py`, are prepared.
*   **Step 4: Prompt Construction (F)**: All these pieces are then combined using `ChatPromptTemplate` to form a comprehensive prompt. This template typically includes a system message (for persona and core instructions), tool descriptions (for tool use guidance), `MessagesPlaceholder` for historical context, and the current user input.
*   **Step 5: LLM Invocation (G)**: The fully constructed prompt is sent to the Gemini LLM. The LLM processes this prompt, understanding the context, its role, available tools, and the task at hand.
*   **Step 6: LLM Response (H)**: The LLM generates a response. This could be a direct answer, a thought process leading to a tool call, or a tool call itself (e.g., `tool_name(args)`). This response is then parsed.
*   **Step 7: State Update (I)**: The agent's [Agent State](chapter_01.md) is updated with the LLM's response or the outcome of a tool invocation, preparing for the next step in the workflow.

This iterative process ensures that the LLM is always working with the most current and relevant information, guided by clear instructions, maximizing its effectiveness within the agent's workflow.

### System Integration

Agent Prompts are a central piece of the `gemini-fullstack-langgraph-quickstart` architecture, acting as the communication bridge between the agent's structured workflow and the unstructured reasoning power of the LLM.

*   **Integration with [Agent State](chapter_01.md)**: The `AgentState` is the primary source of dynamic information for prompt construction. User messages, search results, previous LLM outputs, and any other data accumulated during the agent's operation are pulled from the state and injected into the prompts. This ensures the LLM has full situational awareness and conversational memory.
    *   *Example*: A prompt might include `state["user_message"]` and `state["chat_history"]` to provide the LLM with the current user query and the preceding conversation turns.

*   **Integration with [Agent Tools and Schemas](chapter_03.md)**: Descriptions of the tools available to the agent, along with their input/output schemas, are crucial components of prompts. The LLM needs to understand what tools it has, what they do, and how to invoke them (i.e., the correct function name and arguments). These descriptions are dynamically formatted and included in the system part of the prompt.
    *   *Example*: `prompt.partial(tools=format_tools_for_llm(tools_list))` would embed the descriptions of available tools into the prompt, guiding the LLM's tool-use decisions.

*   **Integration with [Agent Workflow Nodes](chapter_02.md)**: Each node in the agent's graph orchestrates specific actions, and many of these actions involve interacting with the LLM. Nodes are responsible for:
    1.  **Gathering Context**: Collecting necessary information from the `AgentState`.
    2.  **Constructing the Prompt**: Using the gathered context, tool information, and predefined templates (from `prompts.py` or similar), to build a specific prompt for the task.
    3.  **Invoking the LLM**: Sending the constructed prompt to the LLM (e.g., Gemini).
    4.  **Processing LLM Output**: Interpreting the LLM's response, which could be a direct answer, a call to a tool, or a refined plan, and then updating the `AgentState` accordingly.

This tightly integrated system allows the agent to dynamically adapt its prompts based on the current state and available tools, leading to highly intelligent and context-aware behavior throughout its entire workflow.

### Best Practices & Tips

Crafting effective prompts is more an art than a science, but adhering to certain best practices can significantly improve your agent's performance and reliability.

*   **Clarity and Specificity**: Be precise in your instructions. Avoid vague language. Clearly state the task, the desired output format, and any constraints. For example, instead of "answer the question," try "synthesize the search results to answer the user's question in exactly three bullet points, citing sources."
*   **Define Persona and Role**: Give your agent a clear role (e.g., "You are an expert financial analyst" or "You are a helpful research assistant"). This helps the LLM adopt the appropriate tone, knowledge base, and decision-making style.
*   **Provide Constraints and Guardrails**: Explicitly state what the agent *should not* do or what information it should *not* provide. This is crucial for safety, ethical considerations, and staying on topic. For example, "Do not discuss political topics" or "Only use information from the provided search results."
*   **Few-Shot Examples**: For complex tasks, providing 1-3 examples of desired input-output pairs within the prompt can dramatically improve the LLM's ability to follow the pattern. This is often more effective than lengthy textual descriptions.
*   **Dynamic Prompting**: Leverage the [Agent State](chapter_01.md) to make prompts dynamic. Injecting current context (e.g., `get_current_date()`), chat history, or search results ensures the LLM is always working with the most up-to-date information.
*   **Iterative Refinement**: Prompt engineering is an iterative process. Start simple, test, observe the agent's behavior, and then refine your prompts based on the results. Small changes can have significant impacts.
*   **Tool Descriptions**: Ensure that tool descriptions are clear, concise, and accurately reflect their functionality. The LLM relies on these descriptions to decide when and how to invoke tools effectively. Make sure parameter names and types are explicitly mentioned.
*   **Separate Concerns**: Use distinct prompt templates for different stages of your agent's workflow (e.g., one for planning, one for tool invocation, one for final synthesis). This reduces cognitive load on the LLM within a single prompt.

By following these best practices, you can create prompts that effectively guide your Gemini LLM, enabling your LangGraph agent to perform complex tasks with high accuracy and relevance.
