# gemini-fullstack-langgraph-quickstart Tutorial

Welcome to the comprehensive tutorial for gemini-fullstack-langgraph-quickstart. This tutorial is automatically generated from the codebase to help you understand the core concepts and implementation patterns.

## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack application leveraging Google's Gemini models and LangGraph to create an AI research agent. It demonstrates how to build an agent capable of multi-turn interactions, dynamic information retrieval, and structured research workflows. The application combines a frontend user interface with a backend API that orchestrates the agent's actions based on conversational state and configurable parameters.
