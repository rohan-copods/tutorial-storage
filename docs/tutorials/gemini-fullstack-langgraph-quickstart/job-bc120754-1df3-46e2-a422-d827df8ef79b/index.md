# gemini-fullstack-langgraph-quickstart Tutorial

Welcome to the comprehensive tutorial for gemini-fullstack-langgraph-quickstart. This tutorial is automatically generated from the codebase to help you understand the core concepts and implementation patterns.

## Project Overview

This project implements a full-stack AI assistant, integrating a LangGraph-powered backend agent with a React-based user interface. The assistant is designed to interact with users, understand their queries, perform tasks like web research, and provide informed responses, leveraging structured communication and dynamic workflow management.
