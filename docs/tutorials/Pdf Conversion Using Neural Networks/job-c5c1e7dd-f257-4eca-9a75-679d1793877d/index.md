# Pdf Conversion Using Neural Networks Tutorial

Welcome to the comprehensive tutorial for Pdf Conversion Using Neural Networks. This tutorial is automatically generated from the codebase to help you understand the core concepts and implementation patterns.

## Project Overview

The project addresses the inherent structural limitations of PDF documents by employing recurrent neural networks for document structure recovery. This process involves directly converting low-level PDF data into engineered features, which are then processed by a sequence-to-sequence model to identify logical content components. The effectiveness of this neural network-based approach is quantitatively assessed using standard performance and accuracy metrics.
