# lodash Tutorial

Welcome to the comprehensive tutorial for lodash. This tutorial is automatically generated from the codebase to help you understand the core concepts and implementation patterns.

## Project Overview

Lodash is a JavaScript utility library offering a comprehensive suite of functions for common programming tasks, including data manipulation, iteration, and functional programming patterns. It organizes these utilities under a central '_' namespace, supporting both direct function calls and a fluent chaining syntax for enhanced readability and composability. Additionally, 'lodash/fp' provides a specific variant tailored for a pure functional programming paradigm.
