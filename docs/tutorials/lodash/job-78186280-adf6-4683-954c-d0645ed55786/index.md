# lodash Tutorial

Welcome to the comprehensive tutorial for lodash. This tutorial is automatically generated from the codebase to help you understand the core concepts and implementation patterns.

## Project Overview

Lodash is a comprehensive JavaScript utility library offering a wide array of helper functions for common programming tasks like data manipulation and iteration. It provides a consistent API through the main '_' object, alongside a specialized functional programming variant, 'lodash/fp', which emphasizes immutability and composability. The entire library is packaged into various distributions via an internal build system to suit different development needs.


## System Architecture

        L3["3: Functional Programming (FP) Variant"]
    end

    subgraph "Business Logic"
        L1["1: Utility Functions"]
        L2["2: Collection Operations"]
    end

    subgraph "Utilities"
        L4["4: Currying and Placeholders (FP Concept)"]
        L5["5: Build and Distribution"]
    end
