# lodash Tutorial

Welcome to the comprehensive tutorial for lodash. This tutorial is automatically generated from the codebase to help you understand the core concepts and implementation patterns.

## Project Overview

Lodash is a JavaScript utility library providing a wide range of functions for common programming tasks and data manipulations. Its core design revolves around a central root object ('_') that serves as the namespace, exposing individual utility functions, including specialized collection iterators. The library enhances usability through chaining operations for fluent sequences of transformations and offers a distinct functional programming module, 'lodash/fp', for highly composable, data-last function patterns.
