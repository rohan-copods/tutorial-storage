# dayjs Tutorial

Welcome to the comprehensive tutorial for dayjs. This tutorial is automatically generated from the codebase to help you understand the core concepts and implementation patterns.

## Project Overview

Day.js is a lightweight JavaScript library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates. It centers around an immutable 'Day.js Object' that represents a specific date and time. Its modular design allows users to extend core functionalities with optional 'Plugins' and support various internationalization needs through 'Locales'.
